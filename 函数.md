### Pattern（模式）

```haskell
factorial :: (Integral a) => a -> a  
factorial 0 = 1  
factorial n = n * factorial (n - 1)  
```

### Guard（守卫）

```haskell
bmiTell :: (RealFloat a) => a -> a -> String  
bmiTell weight height  
    | weight / height ^ 2 <= 18.5 = "You're underweight, you emo, you!"  
    | weight / height ^ 2 <= 25.0 = "You're supposedly normal. Pffft, I bet you're ugly!"  
    | weight / height ^ 2 <= 30.0 = "You're fat! Lose some weight, fatty!"  
    | otherwise                   = "You're a whale, congratulations!"  
```

### Predicate（谓词）

```haskell
bmiTell :: (RealFloat a) => a -> a -> String  
bmiTell weight height  
    | bmi <= skinny = "You're underweight, you emo, you!"  
    | bmi <= normal = "You're supposedly normal. Pffft, I bet you're ugly!"  
    | bmi <= fat    = "You're fat! Lose some weight, fatty!"  
    | otherwise     = "You're a whale, congratulations!"  
    where bmi = weight / height ^ 2  
          skinny = 18.5  
          normal = 25.0  
          fat = 30.0  
```

### Let Expression（let表达式）

```haskell
cylinder :: (RealFloat a) => a -> a -> a  
cylinder r h = 
    let sideArea = 2 * pi * r * h  
        topArea = pi * r ^2  
    in  sideArea + 2 * topArea  
```
